Class Assignment CSGY 6813

Implement a Defensive Security System
This assignment will help you understand security mechanisms. You will be guided through the steps of creating a reference monitor using the security layer functionality in Repy V2. A reference monitor is an access control concept that refers to an abstract machine that mediates all access to objects by subjects. This can be used to allow, deny, or change the behavior of any set of calls. While not a perfect way of validating your reference monitor, it is useful to create test cases to see whether your security layer will work as expected (the test cases may be turned in as part of the next assignment). Please ask your instructor if test cases are available to you, some instructors may provide with test cases.

This assignment is intended to reinforce concepts about access control and reference monitors in a hands-on manner.
